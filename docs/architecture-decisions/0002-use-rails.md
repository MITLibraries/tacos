# 2. Use Rails

Date: 2023-07-14

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to choose a language and framework in which to write this application.

## Decision

We will use Ruby on Rails.

## Consequences

Using Rails leverages preexisting expertise in EngX and will allow us to build out TACOS more rapidly. At this point,
we are not aware of any functionality this tool will need that Rails cannot provide. However, EngX is the only team in
DLS that uses Rails, so we are committing to sole ownership and maintenance of the application.
