# Navigation

This partial is used to display the navigation in Administrate.
By default, the navigation contains navigation links
for all resources in the admin dashboard,
as defined by the routes in the `admin/` namespace

This local template was forked from the administrate version to allow direct usage of
the `can?` check rather than administrates `accessible_action?` which didn't work in
our environment. Our option was to fork this template or monkey patch that method. This
felt least likely to have undesired side effects as `accessible_action?` is used in more
places than just this and we haven't noted it not working as expected there. If we realize
other templates are also having it not work as needed, we should monkey patch that method
and delete this template.
